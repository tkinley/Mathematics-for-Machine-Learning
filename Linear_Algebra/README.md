## Overview of Gaussian Elimination
Gaussian elimination is a method used to solve systems of linear equations. The goal is to transform the system's augmented matrix into a form that makes it easy to solve for the unknown variables.

## Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Augmented Matrix
First, we need to represent the system of linear equations as an augmented matrix. This combines the coefficient matrix (A) and the constants vector (B).

### Step 2: Transform Matrix into Row Echelon Form
Next, perform row operations to convert the augmented matrix into row-echelon form. The goal is to get zeros below the leading diagonal (the diagonal from the top-left to the bottom-right).

The aim is to transform the matrix to a form where it looks like this:

Step 3: Back Substitution
Once the matrix is in row-echelon form, solve for the variables starting from the last row and moving upwards.

For example, if you have:
